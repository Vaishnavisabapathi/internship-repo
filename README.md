# Day 1-2 – OCR Implementation & Answer Sheet Analysis (09/06/2025)

## Task 1: OCR Using Python & Tesseract

### 🎯 Objective
Implement OCR to extract text from scanned documents using Python.

### Tools & Libraries
- Python, OpenCV, Pillow, Tesseract OCR

### Process
- Image preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, thresholding)
- OCR text extraction with Tesseract
- Save extracted content to a `.txt` file

## Task 2: OCR Challenges in Academic Answer Sheets

### 📘 Sheet Types & Insights
- **Theory-Based**: Works well with standard OCR; issues with handwriting
- **Mathematical**: Struggles with formulas, symbols like √, ∑
- **Diagram-Based**: Diagrams not OCR-friendly; needs hybrid image analysis

### Common Challenges
- Blurry/low-res scans
- Handwriting variability
- Complex layouts with text + visuals

### 💡 Takeaway
OCR performance depends on content type. Custom preprocessing and hybrid models are essential for accurate extraction in academic settings.
