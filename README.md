### 🧾 Day 1–2: OCR Implementation & Answer Sheet Analysis (09/06/2025)

#### ✅ Task 1: OCR Using Python & Tesseract

**Objective**  
Implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned documents.

**Tools & Libraries Used**  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Pillow  
- Tesseract OCR

**Process**  
- Preprocessed images: grayscale conversion, resizing, thresholding  
- Performed OCR using Tesseract  
- Exported extracted content to `.txt` files

#### 📄 Task 2: OCR Challenges in Academic Answer Sheets

**Sheet Types & Observations**
- **Theory-Based Sheets**: Standard OCR works; struggles with handwriting
- **Mathematical Sheets**: Struggles with symbols (e.g., √, ∑)
- **Diagram-Based Sheets**: OCR fails with diagrams; requires image analysis

**Challenges Encountered**
- Poor scan quality  
- Handwriting inconsistency  
- Mixed content (text + visuals)

**Key Takeaway**  
OCR effectiveness varies with content type. Accurate results require custom preprocessing and hybrid models tailored to academic formats.

### 💻 Day 3–5: Git & GitHub Overview (13/06/2025)

#### Objective  
Understand and apply version control using Git, and collaborate using GitHub.

#### 🛠️ Git Commands Practiced
- `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`  
- `git status`, `git log --stat`  
- Branching and merging: `git checkout -b`, `git merge`

#### 🌐 GitHub Concepts Covered
- Cloud-based Git repository hosting  
- Pull requests, issues, and collaborative workflows

#### 🧪 Activities Completed
- Created and pushed repositories  
- Tracked code changes with commits  
- Worked on files like `ocr.py`, `main.py`, and `web_scraper.py`  
- Analyzed commit history using `git log --stat`

#### Summary  
Acquired practical experience in source control and collaboration. Strengthened workflow discipline using Git and GitHub.
